### HELPFUL DEFINITIONS:
	Sound - An umbrella term that spans from music to noise.
	Music - Sound, usually crafted intentionally, that uses rhythm, meter,
		pitch, and timbre to create air sculptures.
	Song - Music attended by singing, usually with lyrics.
	Noise - Non-musical sound; often unwanted.
	Antimusic - Sound, crafted intentionally or automatically, that contains
		musical elements, yet is difficult to describe as "music."
	Field-recording - Candid sounds captured in real-time.

	The line can be blurry between different types of sound, depending on
	individuals' perceptions, which in turn is fed by their memories,
	culture, personality, tastes, and a million other descriptive terms.

	The method of defining sound outlined here may be somewhat
	subjective, though I find it helpful when navigating the world of
	sound and when coordinating with others across a range of
	sound-related subjects and tasks.

### LICENSING:
	
	LICENSING.txt contains a brief summary of the license(s) created by
	the author(s) of all works contained in this database.  This licensing
	is in place to protect the rights of the authors, not to restrict them.

	In short, anyone may share sound files from this database as
	long as they attribute authorship to the author(s), the material is not
	being used for commercial purposes, and the work is unaltered.

	The author(s) themselves may use their own work as they see fit.
	
	LICENSING.txt also serves as a declaration of intent to license, thus
	acting as a safeguard blanketing all files in the database under the
	protection of this licensing for the sake of the author(s).

	CREDITS.txt serves as a list of derivitive works and their authors.
	Although it aims to be comprehensive, there is no way to guarantee
	that the list is complete.  It is recommended that you corroborate 
	CREDITS.txt with metadata from individual files in this database if the
	need arises to build a comprehensive list of the authors of derivitive
	works protected under this licensing.
